# Changelog

All new features and capabilities added in this branch (`feature/803264`) are documented below.

## [0.4.0]

### 🚀 New Features

- **Multi-Language Sandbox Template**
  - Added a built-in `multi-language` template for Python, Go, and Bash execution
  - Added Go `1.25.2` to the multi-language runtime base and configured Go build/module caches under `/workspace/.cache`
  - Updated executor shell isolation so `go` is available through Bubblewrap and subprocess execution paths

- **Stable Runtime Base Image Layering**
  - Added stable Python and multi-language runtime base images that contain system/runtime dependencies without executor application code
  - Added final versioned executor/template images built from the stable bases, so template image tags follow the project `VERSION` while heavy runtime layers stay stable
  - Added a shared executor template Dockerfile and removed legacy per-template Dockerfiles and the old direct executor Dockerfile

- **Base Image Build and SWR Push Workflow**
  - Extended `images/build.sh` with optional base-image builds, configurable Python and multi-language base tags, mirror options, platform selection, and `VERSION`-based template tags
  - Added multi-arch SWR base image push support using Docker Buildx OCI archive export and `skopeo copy --all`
  - Added configurable SWR registry, namespace, repository, credentials, builder, OCI output directory, and platform options

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

- **Template Image Version Resolution**
  - Changed default seeded template image URLs to follow `VERSION`, `TEMPLATE_IMAGE_TAG`, or `PROJECT_VERSION` instead of hardcoded `v1.0.0` or `latest` values
  - Added a default multi-language template seed entry and made create-session requests use `DEFAULT_TEMPLATE_ID` when `template_id` is omitted

- **File Upload and Archive Extraction Safety**
  - Made upload size validation use configured limits instead of a hardcoded 100 MB limit
  - Added ZIP extraction limits for file count and total uncompressed size
  - Rejected symlink entries during ZIP extraction to reduce unsafe archive handling risk

- **Session Dependency Install Timeout**
  - Added `install_timeout` support to manual session dependency installation requests
  - Propagated per-request dependency install timeouts to executor session-config sync calls, preventing long installs from being limited by the default executor client timeout

### 🔧 Improvements

- Updated the control-plane Docker build context so the image can include the repository `VERSION` file for default template tag resolution
- Added `image.defaultTemplates.pythonBasic` and `image.defaultTemplates.multiLanguage` Helm values so deployments can override the two built-in template image versions independently
- Renamed the self-contained Helm chart from `sandbox_local` to `sandbox_standalone` to better describe its deployment scope
- Added `.dockerignore` coverage for common caches, local databases, build outputs, and development artifacts
- Expanded unit coverage for default template image resolution, optional session template selection, Go shell execution path handling, ZIP extraction safeguards, and dependency install timeout propagation
- Improved integration test operations with `happy_path` and `slow` pytest markers, stronger per-test session cleanup, updated internal API and health smoke coverage, and workspace tests that reuse the shared session fixture instead of skipping session creation failures
- Removed slow non-happy-path dependency failure checks from the regular integration suite so routine runs focus on stable success paths while full coverage remains available through explicit marker selection

### ⚠️ Breaking Changes

- Default template images now use the project `VERSION` as their tag unless overridden by environment variables
- The image build workflow now supports only the built-in `python-basic` and `multi-language` templates through the shared executor Dockerfile
- Operators that build the control-plane image directly must use the repository root as the Docker build context so `VERSION` is available in the image

### 📚 Documentation

- Updated README, build documentation, project structure docs, deployment notes, and the multi-language Go execution design to describe the new image layering and SWR push workflow
- Documented integration test run modes for happy-path smoke tests, full runs, slow-only runs, and full runs excluding slow tests
- Added `deploy/helm/README.md` to explain the difference between the BKN Foundry component chart and the standalone Sandbox chart
- Rewrote the Helm chart READMEs so `deploy/helm/sandbox` documents the Core component deployment and `deploy/helm/sandbox_standalone` documents the self-contained stack with Web, MariaDB, and MinIO

## [0.3.3]

### 🚀 New Features

- **Control Plane Takeover for K8s Sessions**
  - Added startup takeover flow so a restarted or upgraded control plane can detect active K8s session pods created by a previous control-plane pod
  - Added control-plane pod identity propagation (`POD_NAME`, `POD_UID`) and executor pod owner references so recreated session pods are rebound to the current control plane
  - Added startup takeover handling for interrupted in-flight executions, marking them failed when the executor pod must be recreated during upgrade

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

- **Session Recovery Stability After Control Plane Restart**
  - Fixed K8s session recovery to resolve templates from the direct template repository during startup state sync, preventing recovery failures caused by missing template resolution
  - Fixed same-name pod recreation conflicts by waiting for stale terminating pods to be fully deleted before retrying executor pod creation
  - Refreshed recovered sessions' activity timestamps after takeover recovery so the idle cleanup task does not immediately terminate newly recovered sessions

- **K8s Session Scheduling Resource Requests**
  - Changed K8s sandbox session pods to use zero CPU and memory requests while keeping runtime limits unchanged
  - Reduces session startup failures caused by per-session resource reservations blocking pod scheduling in constrained clusters

### 🔧 Improvements

- Added direct session and execution repository support for startup state sync so takeover logic can paginate all active sessions and persist interrupted execution state changes without request-scoped dependencies
- Expanded unit coverage for K8s takeover, owner reference handling, stale pod recreation conflicts, dependency wiring, and recovery activity refresh

### 📚 Documentation

- Added PRD and design docs for control-plane and executor lifecycle binding during restart and upgrade scenarios
- Added a `sandbox_standalone` Helm chart with standalone deployment templates, component metadata, RBAC, and operational documentation for packaging and environment setup

  - Updated control plane, web, MariaDB, MinIO, default template, and BusyBox image references to use `image.<name>.repository` and `image.<name>.tag`
  - Removed the hardcoded web initContainer BusyBox image so offline packaging tools can discover it from chart values
  - Updated Helm README, local install overrides, and component image metadata to match the new image structure
