# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [Unreleased]

### Changed

- Renamed the module directory from `trace-ai/` to `bkn-trace/` to align with the platform-wide `bkn-*` naming (display name: BKN Trace). The Go module path changed to `github.com/openbkn-ai/bkn-foundry/bkn-trace/agent-observability`; CI/release workflows, CODEOWNERS, and issue routing were updated accordingly. Image and chart names (`agent-observability`, `otelcol-contrib`) are unchanged.

## [0.2.2] - 2026-04-10

### Improvements

- Changed the default `agent-observability` chart image tag to the `__VERSION__` placeholder so the packaged chart can inherit the resolved release version during the release workflow.
- Updated the `agent-observability` release workflow to replace the `__VERSION__` placeholder in chart values before packaging, keeping the chart default image tag aligned with the released image tag.

## [0.2.1] - 2026-04-07

### Improvements

- Standardized the `agent-observability` and `otelcol-contrib` Helm chart image values to use `image.registry`, `image.repository`, and `image.tag`, so offline packaging can extract images from the default values.
- Updated the `agent-observability` release workflow to write the resolved release version into the chart default `image.tag` before packaging.

### Upgrade Notes

- If you override `image.repository` with a full image reference that includes the registry, split it into `image.registry` and `image.repository` to match the new chart values structure.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-03-31

### Improvements

- Updated the release workflows under `.github/workflows/` to use the relocated `bkn-trace/` paths for version resolution, Go module discovery, Docker build context, and Helm chart packaging.

### Documentation

- Added a reference command in `README.md` for creating and verifying the multi-architecture manifest of `opentelemetry-collector-contrib` in SWR.

## [0.1.1] - 2026-03-27

### Improvements

- Increased the default result size limit to `1000` for the conversation-based trace search API so a single request can return more matching traces.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-03-25

Initial project release.
