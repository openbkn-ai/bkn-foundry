# 05 · Skill Routing Loop — KN-driven Skill Governance

> 3 materials trigger the same critical alert; the Decision Agent picks 3 different
> handling paths — each justified by the knowledge network.

## The Story

Continuing from example 03's procurement engineer: she now sees the disposition
plan already chosen on each alert. Three materials. Three paths. Zero prompts
edited. The `applicable_skill` relation in the business knowledge network is
the single source of truth — the agent picks from whatever `find_skills`
returns, nothing else.

## What this shows

Five components co-operate in a verifiable end-to-end loop:

| Component | Role |
|---|---|
| **execution-factory** | registers and versions the 3 Skill packages |
| **business knowledge network (BKN)** | binds Skills to materials via `applicable_skill` |
| **Vega** | maps BKN ObjectTypes to MySQL tables (read-mostly) |
| **context-loader (`find_skills`)** | recalls applicable skills per material instance |
| **Decision Agent** | reads BKN evidence, picks a Skill, emits a verifiable decision |
| **run.sh verifier** | asserts the Agent route, calls the mock business endpoint, checks logs |

## Prerequisites

- `openbkn` CLI (`npm install -g @openbkn/bkn-sdk`, Node ≥ 22)
- BKN Foundry with **Decision Agent + execution-factory + Vega** enabled
  (use `openbkn auth login <platform-url> [--insecure]` first)
- A MySQL instance reachable from the BKN Foundry (NOT from your laptop)
  with CREATE/INSERT/SELECT/UPDATE on a chosen database
- `python3` (Flask + mysql-connector-python — install via
  `pip install -r tool_backend/requirements.txt`)
- An LLM model registered in the platform's model factory (find its ID via
  `openbkn call /api/mf-model-manager/v1/llm/list`)

Quick self-check that platform components are reachable:

```bash
openbkn auth whoami                                      # logged in?
openbkn call /api/mf-model-manager/v1/llm/list | head    # LLM factory reachable?
openbkn call /api/agent-operator-integration/v1/mcp/     # execution-factory reachable?
```

## Quick Start

```bash
cd examples/05-skill-routing-loop
cp env.sample .env
vim .env                                    # fill PLATFORM_HOST, LLM_ID, DB_*
pip install -r tool_backend/requirements.txt
./run.sh                                    # ~5 minutes end-to-end
./run.sh --bonus                            # also run the Bonus segment with verification
```

> **Concurrency caveat:** Do not run two instances of `./run.sh` concurrently.
> The script uses a fixed `KN_ID` (`ex05_skill_routing`) AND fixed Skill names
> (`standard_replenish` / `substitute_swap` / `supplier_expedite`); a second
> run will collide on Skill registration and the cleanup of either run will
> delete the other run's KN.

## What you will see

| Material | KN evidence | DA picks | Why |
|---|---|---|---|
| MAT-001 | binds to `substitute_swap`; SUB-001A/B in stock | substitute_swap | Python scorer ranks substitutes; calls MES |
| MAT-002 | binds to `supplier_expedite`; SUP-2 capability=expedite | supplier_expedite | Supplier can rush — POST to supplier portal |
| MAT-003 | binds to `standard_replenish` only | standard_replenish | Default path — issue PO via ERP |

The script stores each Agent response in `.chat-<SKU>.log`, asserts that the
expected Skill name appears, then calls the local mock business backend and
checks `.tool_backend.log` for:

```text
[mes/swap]
[supplier/expedite]
[procurement]
```

Seeing `✓ mock backend observed MES, supplier, and ERP calls` means all three
business actions reached the mock backend.

If you also want `builtin_skill_execute_script` in the platform sandbox to hit
the mock backend directly, set `TOOL_BACKEND_PUBLIC_URL` in `.env` to an address
reachable from the platform/sandbox, such as `http://<host>:8765` on an internal
network. The default `http://127.0.0.1:8765` is only guaranteed for the local
verifier; `127.0.0.1` inside the platform sandbox is not your laptop.

## Bonus — change business → KN rebuild → AI follows

Run `./run.sh --bonus`. The script POSTs to the mock business backend's admin
endpoint to re-bind MAT-002 from `supplier_expedite` to the newly registered
`standard_replenish` Skill ID. This updates `materials.bound_skill_id` in
MySQL, which drives the `applicable_skill` direct-mapping FK. It then triggers
`openbkn bkn build` to
refresh the underlying Vega resource snapshot, then re-asks the Agent about
MAT-002. The Decision Agent's next `find_skills` call returns the new
candidate set and it switches to `standard_replenish` — without any prompt
edit or redeploy.

> **Why the rebuild — and why it's not a platform requirement:** This example
> uses Vega's **batch-mode** dataview, which serves graph queries from a
> snapshot taken at build time. Direct-mapping relations like
> `applicable_skill` are computed live at query time, but the underlying data
> is the snapshot — so MySQL UPDATEs only surface after the next build. Vega
> also supports a **streaming-mode** resource (Debezium CDC over Kafka) where
> updates propagate in seconds with no manual rebuild; that's the production
> path. We use batch here so the demo runs with just one MySQL — no Kafka,
> no Debezium, no extra infra.

## How it works (deeper read)

See [`docs/superpowers/specs/2026-04-27-skill-routing-loop-example-design.md`](../../docs/superpowers/specs/2026-04-27-skill-routing-loop-example-design.md)
for the full design including:
- BKN schema and the `applicable_skill` direct-mapping FK
- Why MCP server registration must include `X-Kn-ID` header
- Why agent `mode` must be `"react"` (default mode skips tool wiring)
- Why the script registers Skills first, then renders CSVs and agent config with real Skill IDs
- The 3-step state machine for cleaning up MCPs and Skills

## Troubleshooting

If you see `builtin_skill_load returned 404` in the chat trace, the
`skills.skill_id` values in BKN or the `skills[].skill_id` values in the agent
config are not aligned with the real Skill IDs returned by execution-factory.
The script now registers Skills first, then renders CSVs and agent config with
those real IDs, so this should not happen in a healthy run.

## Cleanup

Resources (KN, MCP, Skills, Agent, Datasource, mock backend process) are
deleted automatically on script exit, success or failure.
